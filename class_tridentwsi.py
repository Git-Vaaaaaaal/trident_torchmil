class TridentTMADataset(ProcessedMILDataset):
    r"""
    This class represents a dataset of Whole Slide Images (WSI) for Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) that was processed using the [TRIDENT](https://github.com/mahmoodlab/TRIDENT) repository.

    **Directory structure.**
    For more information on the processing of the bags, refer to the [`ProcessedMILDataset` class](processed_mil_dataset.md).
    This dataset expects the directory structure provided by the TRIDENT repository. The `base_path` argument should point to the base directory of the TRIDENT output, of the form `{mag}x_{ps}px_{opx}px_overlap/`. In this folder, the following folders are expected:
    ```
    base_path
    ├──features_{feature_extractor}
    |   ├── wsi1.h5
    |   ├── wsi2.h5
    |   └── ...
    ├──patches
    |   ├── wsi1_patches.h5
    |   ├── wsi2_patches.h5
    |   └── ...
    └──patch_labels (optional)
        ├── wsi1.h5
        ├── wsi2.h5
        └── ...
    ```

    **Adjacency matrix.**
    If the coordinates of the patches are available, an adjacency matrix representing the spatial relationships between the patches is built. Please refer to the [`ProcessedMILDataset` class](processed_mil_dataset.md) for more information on how the adjacency matrix is built.

    **WSI-level labels.**
    The labels of the WSIs can be provided in two ways:
    1. As a directory containing one file per WSI, following the same structure as the features and patches folders.
    2. As a CSV file containing the WSI names and their corresponding labels. In this case, the user must provide the column names for the WSI names and labels using the `wsi_name_col` and `wsi_label_col` keyword arguments, respectively.

    **Patch-level labels.**
    The labels of the patches can be provided through the `patch_labels_path` argument. This should be a directory containing one '.h5' file per WSI. This file should have "patch_labels" as a key, which should contain an array with the labels of the patches. The order of the patch labels should be the same as the order of the features and coordinates of the patches.
